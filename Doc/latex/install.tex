Installing {\itshape G\+L\+A\+M\+ER} is a mostly straightforward process, thanks to the {\itshape C\+Make} build system which handles configuration options, dependency resolution, and integration into projects.\hypertarget{install_autotoc_md0}{}\doxysection{The build system}\label{install_autotoc_md0}
The {\itshape G\+L\+A\+M\+ER} libraries are built using the \href{http://www.cmake.org}{\texttt{ C\+Make}} build system. {\itshape C\+Make} is a meta build system which generates the files required by your build environment of choice, such as


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Unix Makefiles
\item Xcode
\item Eclipse
\item ...
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{install_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysubsection{Getting C\+Make}\label{install_autotoc_md1}
The installation of {\itshape C\+Make} on all major platforms is straightforward. There are binary installation packages available on the {\itshape C\+Make} website.

For Linux, {\itshape C\+Make} can be found in most package managers natively.

For Mac OS X, {\itshape C\+Make} is available from both \href{http://www.brew.sh}{\texttt{ Homebrew}}, \href{https://www.macports.org}{\texttt{ Mac\+Ports}} or \href{https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/}{\texttt{ conda}}.\hypertarget{install_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsection{Using C\+Make}\label{install_autotoc_md2}
{\itshape C\+Make} is a command-\/line tool that takes input files (called {\ttfamily C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt}) and processes them into files for your build system of choice (via a generator), optionally taking into account project-\/specific options. The normal workflow is the following\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Get source code containing {\ttfamily C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt} files for cmake to process.
\item Create a new subdirectory which will contain the generated files. This is, in the language of cmake, an \char`\"{}out-\/of-\/source\char`\"{} build and the preferred mode of operation, since it does not contaminate the source directory (and cmake generates quite a number of files). The subdirectory is usually called \char`\"{}build\char`\"{}.
\item Call cmake with appropriate arguments to generate files for your build system (or I\+DE).
\item Build using your usual method of choice.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{install_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Dependancies}\label{install_autotoc_md3}
Before starting to configure and build {\itshape G\+L\+A\+M\+ER}, it is advisable to resolve all necessary dependencies, since the cmake configuration will automatically detect settings based on the libraries it can find.

All the dependancies should be available through the package managment system \href{https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/}{\texttt{ conda}}. It is recommended that you use this to install and update the dependencies.

The {\itshape G\+L\+A\+M\+ER} library requires some libraries by default and others are optional.

\hypertarget{install_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Building the library}\label{install_autotoc_md4}
After extracting the library, you will be find a directory structure that contains folders for the individual {\itshape G\+L\+A\+M\+ER} sub-\/libraries, together with an additional {\ttfamily examples} folder containing a sample project, and a {\ttfamily cmake} folder containing necessary files for {\itshape C\+Make}.

In order to build {\itshape G\+L\+A\+M\+ER} using cmake, the following steps are necessary\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Create a {\ttfamily build} directory for building the {\itshape G\+L\+A\+M\+ER} libraries. \begin{DoxyVerb}$ mkdir build
$ cd build
\end{DoxyVerb}

\item Run {\ttfamily cmake} with arguments. You will probably want to set the generator and maybe some of the {\itshape G\+L\+A\+M\+ER}-\/specific options. Here we generate Unix Makefiles and enable {\itshape F\+I\+TS} and {\itshape F\+F\+TW} functions. \begin{DoxyVerb}$ cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles" [-DENABLE_GSL=ON]
\end{DoxyVerb}

\item At this point, you are presented with a Makefile or project inside the {\ttfamily build} directory which you can use to build the library. \begin{DoxyVerb}$ make
\end{DoxyVerb}

\end{DoxyEnumerate}

The last step of course depends on the type of generator you choose (using the {\ttfamily -\/G} flag). For I\+D\+Es like Xcode or Eclipse, you have to open the project that {\itshape C\+Make} generated and build the library from within the I\+DE.\hypertarget{install_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsection{Rebuilding}\label{install_autotoc_md5}
A very useful feature of cmake is that it caches all the configuration options you set in previous runs. Thus it is not necessary to specify options you want to keep unchanged on subsequent runs. Continuing the above example, you could turn off {\itshape F\+F\+TW} support using \begin{DoxyVerb}$ cmake .. -DENABLE_FFTW=OFF
\end{DoxyVerb}


while keeping the generator and {\ttfamily E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+F\+I\+TS} options untouched.

It is necessary to regenerate the build files when sources are added or removed. Luckily, your build system should automatically check whether {\ttfamily cmake} needs to be rerun for you before building.\hypertarget{install_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysection{Build options}\label{install_autotoc_md6}
Options can be set from the command-\/line using \begin{DoxyVerb}cmake .. -G <generator> -D<option>=<value>
\end{DoxyVerb}


For a list of available generators, use {\ttfamily cmake -\/h}.

The following options can be passed to {\ttfamily cmake} for building {\itshape G\+L\+A\+M\+ER}\+:

This is used in only one place and should be considered obsolete.\hypertarget{install_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysection{Using G\+L\+A\+M\+ER}\label{install_autotoc_md9}
Once the {\itshape G\+L\+A\+M\+ER} libraries are built inside your build tree, they can be linked with your executables as usual. However, you might want to try and manage your project with {\itshape C\+Make} instead.

Having built the {\itshape G\+L\+A\+M\+ER} libraries with C\+Make makes it easy to integrate them into projects. Most of the process is automated by {\itshape C\+Make}. It is important to have built {\itshape G\+L\+A\+M\+ER} before setting up a project, since {\itshape C\+Make} then remembers where to find the libraries.\hypertarget{install_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysubsection{Creating new projects}\label{install_autotoc_md10}
The easiest way to start a project is to copy the sample project from the {\ttfamily examples/project} folder or clone one of the example projects from the \mbox{[}Glenco Github page\mbox{]}(\char`\"{}https\+://github.\+com/glenco\char`\"{}), specifically \mbox{[}Example1\mbox{]}(\char`\"{}https\+://github.\+com/glenco/\+Example1\char`\"{}), \mbox{[}Example\+Image\mbox{]}(\char`\"{}https\+://github.\+com/glenco/\+Example\+Image\char`\"{}) and \mbox{[}Particle\+Example\mbox{]}(\char`\"{}https\+://github.\+com/glenco/\+Particle\+Example\char`\"{}). The new project should be in its own directory outside of the {\itshape G\+L\+A\+M\+ER} directory tree.

In the enclosed {\ttfamily C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt} file, all instances of the \char`\"{}sample\char`\"{} name have to be replaced with the actual name of the project. Sources and headers can be added to the appropriate lists.\hypertarget{install_autotoc_md11}{}\doxysubsection{Existing cmake projects}\label{install_autotoc_md11}
For projects already using {\itshape C\+Make}, integrating {\itshape G\+L\+A\+M\+ER} is as simple as calling \begin{DoxyVerb}find_package(GLAMER NO_MODULE REQUIRED)
\end{DoxyVerb}


before creating any targets. This will load the {\itshape G\+L\+A\+M\+ER} configuration, import the library targets and set variables containing the include directories and libraries necessary for {\itshape G\+L\+A\+M\+ER}, including all dependencies. These can then be set using the usual \begin{DoxyVerb}include_directories(${GLAMER_INCLUDE_DIRS})
\end{DoxyVerb}


and \begin{DoxyVerb}target_link_libraries(<target> ${GLAMER_LIBRARIES})
\end{DoxyVerb}


functions.\hypertarget{install_autotoc_md12}{}\doxysubsection{Building projects}\label{install_autotoc_md12}
Projects are built using {\itshape C\+Make} in the same way the libraries are built. After creating a build tree, cmake will configure and generate a project which can subsequently be used with the build tool of choice. \begin{DoxyVerb}$ cd myproject
$ ls
CMakeLists.txt  main.cpp
$ mkdir build
$ cmake .. -G Xcode
$ open myproject.xcodeproj
\end{DoxyVerb}
 or \begin{DoxyVerb}$ cd myproject
$ ls
CMakeLists.txt  main.cpp
$ mkdir build
$ cmake .. 
$ make
\end{DoxyVerb}
 If you are not using Xcode.

{\bfseries{Note\+:}} Building the project will not build the G\+L\+A\+M\+ER libraries automatically!
