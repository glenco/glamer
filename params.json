{"name":"GLAMER","tagline":"A flexible computer code for doing simulations of gravitational lensing.","body":"GLAMER (Gravitational Lensing with Adaptive Mesh Refinement) is a C++ library for doing gravitational lensing simulations using the output of cosmological simulations or analytic lens models or combinations of them.  It can do weak lensing simulations on large scales, strong lensing simulations and quasars microlensing simulations.  A description of the code and its applications is available in the papers [Metcalf & Petkova](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.445.1942M) and [Petkova, Metcalf & Giocoli](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.445.1954P) which should be cited if it is used in your academic work.  \r\n\r\n#Documentation:\r\n\r\nThe documentation for the library is available at [GLAMERDOC++](http://metcalf1.bo.astro.it).  There is a description of some functionality on the front page.\r\n\r\n#Access:\r\n\r\nAccess to the code through GitHub can be obtained upon request sent to Ben Metcalf (robertbenton.metcalf@gmail.com).  You will need a GitHub account.\r\n\r\n#Installation:\r\n\r\nFor basic installation instructions see the README file for this project. For more information on installation and linking to your own code see the wiki for this project.\r\n\r\n#Examples\r\n\r\nSome example programs that use the GLAMER library will soon be available on GitHub.  Or you can contact Ben for specific examples.\r\n\r\nThis work is funded by the European Research Council (ERC) through grant agreement  n.\r\n259349.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
